# DroidOTA (Android Over The Air)

> A single solution to build customized android application on the cloud. Build using Node.js (runtime environment) and Ionic as framework to generate a single page application.

**Tech Stacks used:**

* Node.js
* Ionic
* Html
* Css
* JS/TS
* Bash

**Why Ionic ?**

> Ionic is a cross platform mobile application framework and runs along with Node.js also it generates some boilerplate for single page application.
>
> Also we ❤️ Ionic

Ionic uses Angular 4+ and hence contains html, css and ts files to render a page and apply business logic to it.

**Motivation**

> It got this idea after I build a Github Action pipeline for Building android application [here](https://gauravprasadgp.medium.com/ionic-3-4-build-using-github-actions-50900cb1c820) . I reverse engineered this pipeline and Voila! I got motivated to build a frontend oriented single  page mobile application on Cloud VM.
